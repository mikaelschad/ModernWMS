Main pain points in current WMS.

1. Most of the UI is English only
2. Invoicing methods should allow for more flexibility
3. It's too easy for an end user to make mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes are irreversible.
4. There should be more configurable restrictions depending on the customer or the facility.
